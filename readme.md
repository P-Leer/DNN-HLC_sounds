This repository contains audio examples of different hearing-loss compensation systems, which can be accessed through the GitHub Pages site or directly in the repository.

## Audio files

The sentences are sentences from the Danish HINT, that we used to evaluate our proposed algorithms on, using a cohort of hearing-impaired listeners .
